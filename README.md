# 1. How do I approach designing software?

With designing the scene for my 3D model, teh new skills I gained hlped me craft a realistic scene. I learn how to work with camera movement with showing either a persepctive view or an orthographic view. I also learned how to work textures and colors, mouse scroll movements with controlling the speed, lighting,  and how to create an object in general. I beleive these tatcics could help me in the future if I became a game developer or worked with clients with creating realistic products for their company.

# 2. How do I approach developing programs?
I think each milestone helped with creating a realstic scene. Every one of tehm helped break down the main fucntions and factiors of rendering a 3D scene, so towards the end everything fell into place. 

# 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help accomplish my goals with becoming a software engineer. This course in particular gave me a new outlook on what I can do with programming.
